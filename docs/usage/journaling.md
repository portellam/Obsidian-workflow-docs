# Journaling

## Write journal entries
Every daily and periodic notes has a `Journal ðŸ““` section. You may add your
journal entries here.

In daily notes, the `mood` inline field is a `1-5` notation for the day, from
really bad (1) to a productive day (5).

## Query journal entries
The `Journal YYYY ðŸ““.md` file at the root of your vault contains a beatiful
heatmap-calendar from the obsidian-heatmap-calendar plugin.

There's also a query that shows every journal entries from the current year,
allowing you to search for a word inside every journal entries at once in
`obsidian reading view`.
