# Tasks and projects management

## All Docs Index
- [Usage](./README.md)

## The workflow
The workflow is entirely inspired from the book *Getting Things Done* from David
Allen. 

[*Let's see ~Paul~ David Allen's notes...*][01]

1. Add items to the todoist inbox everytime you have an idea or a task to do.
To cite David Allen, the creator of the GTD method, *"Your mind is for having*
*ideas, not holding them"*.

2. Clarify and organize your inbox items and add them to the appropriate part of
your vault (`One-off tasks`, `projects`, `project tasks`, `passions items`,
`someday maybe`). Add tags, dates, and any relevant properties that will make you
do it at the right time in the future or at least remember them.

3. Engage with your tasks and projects by using your daily note to direct your
actions. I personally pick the original author's tasks from the `Today ☀️` section of the original author's daily note,
and I copy them to `Super Productivity`. I then add an estimated time to each task
and start working on them.

4. Review your system periodicly to make sure you are on track and that you have
not forgotten anything. I personally do it on Sunday evening.

## The Daily Note
The Daily Note is the main part of your workflow. It has:

- Links to access higher periods
- Links to access previous and next days

- Today ☀️ section -> Contains tasks with a `happens date` set to today or
before, or tasks in progress. Tasks are then grouped by projects or tasks, and by
due or overdue. You also get a small `#next` actions querry.

- Notes 📝 section -> For adding notes and tasks as `one-off tasks`.

- Inbox 📥 section -> A simple `todoist-inbox-query` to see easily if you have
[captured][02] items to [clarify and organize][03].

- Dashboard 🗺️ section -> Multiple queries to see overdue, do today, upcoming in
the next 30 days, recurring tasks, next actions, projects,  waiting for tasks,
delegated tasks, and your focus and goals.

- Passions 🎮 section -> A query that get your current passions and media from
your `Passions Backlog 🎮` kanban board. It uses the `Doing` keyword in titles to
get the current passions and media.

- Logs 🪵 section -> A query that get your created tasks and projects as well as
your tasks and projects done today.

- Daily Focus 🔥 & Goals 🎯 section -> Add your daily focuses and goals here as
markdown tasks. A tag `#focus` or `#goals` is required.

- Journal 📓 section -> Add your journal entries here. The `mood` inline field is
a `1-5` notation for the day, from really bad (1) to a productive day (5).

## The Periodic Notes
You get almost the same sections as the daily notes, but you also have:

- A [modified Tasks-Calendar][04] in the Dashboard 🗺️ in the weekly and monthly
notes.

- Underground 🚇 section -> Queries that have projects grouped by areas, useful
when trying to balance workload. You also get the unplanned and on hold tasks and
projects queries.
