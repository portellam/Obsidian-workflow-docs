## Tasks within notes, with links to other notes
It embraces many relevant and high level productivity concepts alongside
[Obsidian's][1] [powerful note linking feature][2] while still being usable as a
simple "I create a simple daily checklist with a few notes" in case of existential
crisis. â†’ That means the system will **last**.

## Offline access and data possession
Of course using Obsidian also mean **offline access** and **data possession**. You
may sync your data yourself using [obsidian-git][3] plugin. If the mobile
(Android) version doesn't work the way you want - despite the plugin active
development - you may follow one of the original author's guides:

- [One using cron jobs to sync at regular intervals][4]
- [Another one that sync at Obsidian's app startup][5]

Or just pay for the encrypted [obsidian-sync][6] official plugin.
